### What is Maya?

Maya is an AI-powered lead booking and qualification assistant designed to help businesses automatically follow up with leads, qualify them, and schedule bookings — all without human intervention.

### Key Features
	-	⚡ Instant follow-up: Respond to new leads within seconds to reduce drop-off.
	-	🤖 AI lead qualification: Chat with leads to understand their needs and filter out low-quality ones.
	-	📅 Smart scheduling: Integrates with tools like Calendly or your own API to suggest real-time available slots.
	-	💬 Multi-channel messaging: Works via web chat, SMS, or WhatsApp.
	-	🔗 Easy integration: Connects via embed, Zapier, or API.
	-	🧭 Business-aware responses: Uses your rules, FAQs, and data to reply contextually.

Maya engages, qualifies, and books leads for you 24/7 — helping you convert more inquiries into real appointments.

### What “Increase Your Lead-to-Booking Rate” Means

“Lead-to-booking rate” measures how many leads actually schedule a call, meeting, or appointment.

Maya's promise:
	-	Responding instantly keeps potential clients engaged.
	-	The AI handles qualification and scheduling automatically.
	-	This reduces lost leads and saves your team time — resulting in more bookings per lead.

⚙️ How It Works
	1.	Lead Capture
A visitor fills a form, clicks an ad, or interacts with your chat widget. The data flows into Maya.
	2.	Instant Engagement
Maya automatically greets the lead via chat, SMS, or WhatsApp within seconds.
	3.	Qualification Chat
The assistant asks relevant questions (needs, service type, timing, etc.) to assess fit.
	4.	Booking Suggestion
It checks your connected calendar (Calendly or API) and offers two available time slots.
	5.	Confirmation & Handoff
Once booked, Maya sends details to your CRM or email, along with a summary of the chat.
	6.	Continuous Sync
Lead and booking data stay synced with your systems.
