Supmaya saves you time by creating AI‑powered contextual forms to qualify your contacts.

Simply create your script using our AI generator and let Supmaya gather higher‑quality leads. Once contacts are qualified, you can manage them in your dashboard and view a clean, structured summary.

We also support Webhooks and Zapier triggers so you can instantly send newly qualified leads to your CRM or any other destination.

## Why Supmaya?

Supmaya replaces slow, manual qualification with a swift, conversational engine that adapts to your workflow. Instead of wrestling with rigid forms or sifting through unstructured notes, you get organised, insight‑ready profiles that feel like they assembled themselves.

## How It Works

1. **Build Your Script** – Use the AI generator to craft questions and logic tailored to your lead type.
2. **Share the Form** – Publish your contextual form wherever your contacts interact.
3. **Receive Qualified Leads** – Supmaya analyses responses, applies your criteria, and marks the lead as qualified or unqualified.
4. **Act Immediately** – Push results into your CRM, automate follow‑ups, or trigger workflows via Webhooks and Zapier.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive AI Forms** that react to answers in real time.
- **Smart Summaries** that present insights instead of raw text.
- **Automated Routing** via Webhooks and Zapier.
- **Dashboard Management** for tracking, filtering, and reviewing every qualified contact.
- **Fast Setup** so teams can launch new qualification flows in minutes.

## Who It's For

Supmaya helps sales teams, agencies, recruiters, and service businesses that need reliable qualification without repetitive manual screening. If your workflow depends on separating high‑intent contacts from casual enquiries, Supmaya gives you a sharper, faster tool.

## Ready to Start?

Create your first script, share your form, and watch high‑quality leads roll in—Supmaya handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on closing, not qualifying.
