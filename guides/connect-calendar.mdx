## Calendly integration

You can integrate with your Calendly event to allow the bot to check for booking availability in real time.

1. Navigate to your `Bot` edit page and click the `Calendars` tab.
2. Click the `Connect` button under Calendly and login to your Calendly account.
3. Next, click the `Set channel` button at the top of the page to select Calendly as the calendar channel.
4. Now, click the `Set event` button to choose the Calendly event calendar you wish the bot to refer to.
5. Your bot will now search during your leads conversations for upcoming availability and provide a Calendly booking link at the end of the conversation.

## API integration

Maya supports a custom API endpoint that the Bot will query for upcoming availability. You may use the [mock availability](/api-reference/calendar/mock-availability) api path to test the expected response.

The response must follow the format below exactly or it will fail.

Maya currently supports the following query paramaters which will be dynamically included in the Bot AI tooling request.

`start_time` - ISO8601 start date-time (defaults to tomorrow)

`end_time` - ISO8601 end date-time (defaults to start + 7 days)

`limit` - Maximum number of slots to return (default 24)

### Response format

```
[
    {
        "start_time_utc":"2025-11-07T09:00:00Z",
        "start_time_local":"2025-11-07T09:00:00+00:00",
        "timezone":"UTC",
        "invitees_remaining":1,
        "status":"available",
        "scheduling_url":"http:\/\/supmaya.com\/api\/calendar\/mock-book?time=2025-11-07T09%3A00%3A00%2B00%3A00"
    },
    {
        "start_time_utc":"2025-11-07T14:00:00Z",
        "start_time_local":"2025-11-07T14:00:00+00:00",
        "timezone":"UTC",
        "invitees_remaining":1,
        "status":"available",
        "scheduling_url":"http:\/\/supmaya.com\/api\/calendar\/mock-book?time=2025-11-07T14%3A00%3A00%2B00%3A00"
    }
]
```
The `scheduling_url` will be provided to the lead to book within your booking system.

### Setting the custom calendar API path

1. Navigate to your `Bot` edit page and click `Calendar`.
2. Ensure API is set as the calendar channel at the top of the page.
3. Next, paste in your `POST` endpoint that the bot will query. The path must be `https` and publicaly accessable.
4. Use the `Playground` on the bot edit page to test after setting up.
