Currently, we support two methods of sending out recently qualified leads `webhook` and `zapier`.

## Webhooks

1. Navigate to your `agents` edit page and scroll down to the `Webhook URL` field to enter where you'd like opportunity records to be passed to as a `POST` request.

```json webhook_payload_example.json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Daniel Brooks - 2025-11-25 12:09:12",
  "status": "qualified",
  "summary": "Lead Daniel Brooks expressed desire to save costs and help the environment. Property is a house located in Texas area. Has access to grants/financing; pricing will be provided via a quote based on system size.",
  "follow_up_type": "email",
  "contact": {
    "first_name": "Daniel",
    "last_name": "Brooks",
    "company": null,
    "email": "danielbrooks@example.com",
    "phone": "+123456789"
  },
  "agent": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Onboarding demo"
  },
  "created_at": "2025-11-25 12:09:12"
}
```

2. As you can see above, the `JSON` payload will be sent to your desired `POST` route. We don't attempt to send this again if it fails currently. If you are experiencing failed webhook events, please [get in touch](mailto:support@supmaya.com) and we will attempt to resend once fixed on your end.

## Zapier

We currently have Zapier trigger support implemented to allow Zapier to listen for new qualification entries.
