## Embed widgets

Navigate to our [embed widgets](/guides/embed-widgets) guide on how to gather leads from your website. 

<Note>Embed widgets will only talk to the lead via chat channels. Please use our integration methods below for SMS and WhatsApp channels.</Note>

## Zapier

The easiest way to send non-website leads into Maya is via Zapier. You can integrate in minutes via our [Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/app/login?next=/developer/public-invite/230642/99930758ff8c51102e37ca140c0d937c/).

For example - send Meta ad leads into Maya by using Zapier.
