## AI qualification script

The goal of Supmaya is to convert and summarise higher quality leads to book on your external system or follow up via email/phone. Part of this flow is to automate the conversation using AI. 

The `Prompt script` is the text that is used to give the bot context about your business.

1. Navigate to your bot edit page and click the `AI prompt` tab.

### Prompt script

You are welcome to write your own script, but we have included a handy AI prompt generator to get you started.

1. On the `AI prompt` tab, click `AI Prompt Builder` button and fill out the fields.
2. Be consise yet informative. The goal is to guide the bot by qualifying, finding booking availability and provide the lead a booking link.

### Example script

```
[START SCRIPT]

What type of business do you run?
[WAIT FOR RESPONSE]

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE]
