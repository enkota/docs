## AI qualification script

The goal of Supmaya is to convert and summarise higher quality leads to book on your external system or follow up via email/phone. Part of this flow is to automate the conversation using AI.

The `Prompt script` is the text that is used to give the agent context about your business.

1. Navigate to your agent edit page and click the `AI prompt` tab.

### Prompt script

You are welcome to write your own script, but we have included a handy AI prompt generator to get you started.

1. On the `AI prompt` tab, click `AI Prompt Builder` button and fill out the fields.
2. Be consise yet informative. The goal is to guide the agent by qualifying, finding booking availability and provide the lead a booking link.

### Example script

It's important to use the `[WAIT FOR RESPONSE]` separator after each question you wish to ask. This will help the AI determine each question.

It's good to keep your script questions brief and informative for the contact to reply to. Add anything that you think is important for the agent to qualify with the contact.

Use `[START SCRIPT]` and `[END SCRIPT]` to determine the cutoff points of the script.

`[KNOWLEDGE BASE]` can be optionally added to let the agent have further context about your product/business if the contact asks follow up questions.

```
[START SCRIPT]
