## AI qualification script

The goal of Supmaya is to convert and summarise higher quality leads to book on your external system or follow up via email/phone. Part of this flow is to automate the conversation using AI.

1. Navigate to your `agent` edit page and scroll down to the `Questions` and `Knowledge Base` fields.
2. `Questions` should have around 5-10 questions max. Any more will result in higher contact drop off rates. (Note: Once a contact has started chatting with the agent after they enter their `email` or `phone number`, it will be counted as an opportunity - even if they don't finish the full conversation).
3. `Knowledge Base` should have information on your product/company which the agent can use in context. For example, a contact may ask `What is your pricing plans?` or `What are your opening hours`.

### Example script

```
- What is the name of your company?

```
