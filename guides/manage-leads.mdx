## Manage leads

When a lead is added in Maya, it will appear under the [leads](https://supmaya.com/leads) page. You wil be able to see the current status and details of each lead and an AI summary of completed conversations.

### Conversation history
Previous lead conversations can be found by clicking a leads name which will open up conversation history.

You can filter by individual conversations if the lead has contacted previously. Clicking the AI summary button on `Completed` status leads, will generate a recap of the conversation the bot had with the lead.

### Edit lead details

You may also edit the lead information from the dropdown tab of this menu too.

<Note>Lead conversations are automatically deleted 1 year after creation as per our Terms & Conditions policies.</Note>
