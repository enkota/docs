## Integrate with Twilio

1. Navigate to the `Bot` edit page and click the `Outbound channels` tab.
2. Click the `Connect` button under Twilio.
3. The number `must not` be used on an existing bot as this can cause active messages to merge into the same SMS conversation.

4. Enter your Twilio approved phone number. If your number is US based, please refer to the [Twilio A2P 10DLC documentation](https://help.twilio.com/articles/1260800720410-What-is-A2P-10DLC-). You can manage your number for approval via the Twilio console.

<Warning>US Twilio numbers must apply for [Twilio A2P 10DLC documentation](https://help.twilio.com/articles/1260800720410-What-is-A2P-10DLC-) before it can be approved.</Warning>

5. Add your `Twilio Messaging Service SID` number which can be found on your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/) under `Develop` -> `Messaging` -> `Services`. 

<Note>It's important you use the `Messaging Service SID` and not your Account SID found on the main dashboard. The messaging service should begin with `MG`.</Note>
